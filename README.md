## Troubleshooting

- **No users in "Assign to..." dropdown:**  
  Make sure your `profiles` table is populated and RLS allows `select`.
- **Cannot add tasks:**  
  Ensure all required fields are filled and your Supabase policies are correct.
- **No tables in Supabase:**  
  Make sure you ran the migration SQL in the SQL Editor.
